          <p>Documented immigrants have legal entitlements that an undocumented immigrant most likely will not have. Documented immigrants under the law can either become citizens eventually or can be  non-citizens but receive a social security number card from the United States Department of State and United States Department of Homeland Security. Since documented immigrants are registered legally according to US Law, they are able to register for Health plans during the enrollment period which normally spans from November 1st to December 15. During this time, both documented immigrants and US Citizens/ Nationals have full access and are entitled to applying for their own health insurance plan. In order to register for Healthcare, you must provide a Social Security Number but documented immigrants will most likely have one. There is also a second enrollment period called the special enrollment period when an individual becomes a US citizen which gives them 60 days to enroll in a health insurance plan. These two enrollment periods are just some of the entitlements which immigrants have when applying for Healthcare. There is also the Affordable Care Act which applies to documented immigrants and is an important entitlement that helps documented immigrants get health insurance. If the documented immigrant’s income is in the range of 100%- 400% of the federal poverty income level and they can’t pay for or don’t receive a health plan from their employer, the documented immigrant is eligible for subsidies which can help you to pay for and receive health insurance. This is similar to the enrollment period and special enrollment period in the sense that you will receive subsidies as well if you are a recent immigrant, ineligible for Medicaid. Another important entitlement that documented immigrants should take advantage of their right to low cost or free health insurance through Medicaid. The necessary documents required to apply include, proof of age, citizenship/ alien status, income, etc. An immigrant can apply for Medicaid if you are a qualified non- citizen such as documented immigrants and if you meet the requirements such as for income and residency. In order to actually register for the program, you can apply through the Health Insurance Marketplace or with your states Medicaid agency. Documented immigrants are completely entitled to register for Medicare and it is an important resource to sign up for if the documented immigrant is having financial or other issues that prevent them from signing up for premium or expensive health insurance. </p>

         <p1> Healthcare is a prominent concern for both undocumented because they do not have a SSN and therefore cannot legally register for many health insurance programs. This leads to many problems if an undocumented immigrant is injured or their family members need medical attention. They aren’t always sure of the resources they can use to get support but especially for undocumented immigrants, healthcare often requires social security and identification in order to apply and receive a healthcare plan. However, there are still many sources from which undocumented immigrants in New York are entitled to in order to receive healthcare. Firstly, children under the age of 19 can apply for the Child Health Plus Program. This service provides free or low cost health insurance to children under the age of 19 if they do not have Medicaid or any form of health insurance. Although they must have a certain income based on their household, this healthcare plan is not dependent on immigration status so undocumented child immigrants can receive healthcare this way. In addition, Medicaid is a popular health insurance plan for low income families but often requires a social security number. However, pregnant women can get Medicaid as long as they meet certain requirements but being pregnant permits higher income thresholds. In addition, according to NYC Health + Hospitals, most of NYC’s services are actually available regardless of one's immigration status such as health care, emergency food and shelter, public safety protection, and emergency assistance. There have been no reported cases of immigrants being deported by agents through medical records or because they applied for health insurance showing how regardless of immigration status, many immigrants can still get the help that they need without fear of being deported or detained by ICE. In addition, undocumented immigrants can find out if they or a family member are actually eligible for health insurance by calling 311 and asking the service for getting covered in NYC. NYC Health + Hospitals also respect your privacy and do not ask about your immigration status. You will only be asked when applying for insurance but you can still receive care without notifying them of your immigration status. Undocumented immigrants can find these NYC Health + Hospitals through Google or using this website :(http://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/). </p1>

         <p2>Even though the Medicare plans listed above only apply to undocumented children and pregnant women, there are ways for other groups of undocumented immigrants to receive forms of healthcare due to their entitlements. Under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, any hospitals participating under the Medicare program must assist anyone who comes to an emergency room with screening and stabilization services. This is completely independent of immigration status so undocumented immigrants are fully entitled to receiving some sort of care within emergency rooms of these hospitals. </p2>

         <p3>Although undocumented immigrants are not supported by laws such as the ACA and cannot apply for health insurance plans in many cases, there are still important entitlements provided that undocumented immigrants can take advantage of without fear of deportation or other legal action. It is important for undocumented immigrants to make sure they learn these entitlements due to the limited coverage and restricted health care they receive. </p3>

          <p>Almost half of New Yorkers get health insurance through work. The rest of them need to make their way through a tangle of public and private options, or go without and keep their fingers crossed that they don't get sick. Just because you are not eligible for a Social Security number does not mean that you are not eligible for health insurance. Any person residing in New York City is eligible for medical care regardless of their immigration status. Many low-income immigrant New Yorkers who are not eligible for federal Medicaid are eligible for the state version.  Regardless of immigration status, all low-income New Yorkers have access to the following programs, New York Medicaid for pregnant women and girls, AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), which includes treatment and medication for New Yorkers who are HIV+/living with AIDS, Child Health Plus for New Yorkers under 19; and Hospital Financial Assistance Law (HFAL) benefits, free or low cost medical care for uninsured or under-insured New Yorkers. In addition to all of the New York programs just mentioned, there are some federal programs that low-income immigrant New Yorkers may also be eligible for: Federally-funded Medicaid is available to those with green cards for at least five years, as well as green card holders who have had green cards for less than five years who are either under 21 or pregnant, or both. Some immigrants in less common immigration statuses are also eligible. All green card holders as well as many other categories of lawful immigrants who purchase health insurance through the New York State Marketplace are eligible for tax credits through the Affordable Care Act (known as ACA or Obamacare). Federally-funded community health care clinics are available to everyone regardless of immigration status. </p>
