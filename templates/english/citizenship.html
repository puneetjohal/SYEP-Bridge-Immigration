          <div class="main">
          The pathways of obtaining citizenship can be very difficult because there are plenty of requirements needed to become a U.S. Citizen. For example, a clean background, being able to speak and write proficiently in English and demonstrating knowledge of U.S. history and government. One can see the requirements to apply for U.S. citizenship <a href="https://www.boundless.com/immigration-resources/u-s-citizenship-requirements/">at this link</a>. In addition, <a href="https://www.usa.gov/become-us-citizen">here</a> is another website that offers resources that can help you learn English, or prepare you for the naturalization test.

          <div class="main">
            When U.S. citizens turn 21, they have the opportunity to sponsor their parents and adjust their citizenship status. This means immigrant parents can obtain a green card via their citizen children. However, there are boundaries and different situations depending mainly on the means of entering the country.

          </a>

          <div class="main">
            If you (the parent) entered the country legally, by means of a work or school visa, then you can adjust your status easily. This includes those who overstay their visa. Even if you came into the country over 10 years ago and have overstayed your visa, you can still adjust your status with minimal pushback. In order to do this, you can file Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative. You will have to provide proof of your U.S. citizenship as well as proof of your parents being your parents. This includes a birth certificate, a marriage certificate, etc. There are different preferences for sponsoring those who aren’t your immediate family but nonetheless, you can still provide them with visas if they are outside of the country. You would provide them with a visa and if you are an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen then your relative would not have to wait in line for a visa, you can just apply and they would obtain it.

            <h4 class="subheading">Illegal Entry/Non-inspection</h4>
          </a>

          <div class="main">
            <p>For those who enter the country illegally, the case varies greatly. If you enter the country without being inspected and/or interviewed by Border Patrol/Customs and don’t get caught, applying for an adjustment of status will result in a much longer, more difficult process. The applicant will have to have their green card meeting outside of the country and can be barred from re-entry, meaning they would have to leave the country for a certain amount of time. Depending on how long you’ve remained in the country, you may have to leave up to 10 years before returning and applying for a new visa, even if your child is a U.S. citizen. If you stay up to a year you would be barred re-entry for three years but if it surpasses a year you would be barred re-entry for 10 years before entering the country again with a visa. The difficult thing about this as well if you came here illegally, is even if you manage to stay in the country, your child would still need to be able to financially sponsor you as well. This is what makes the process difficult for most immigrants who come illegally.</p>
            <p>However, there are many legal resources available for immigrants who need it, whether they came into the country illegally or not. Many of these resources are available pro bono. For example, organizations like Unlocal Inc. and NYLAG provide free legal and honest services to immigrants in NYC, regardless of your immigration status.</p>

            <h4 class="subheading">Obtaining Citizenship</h4>
          </a>

          <div class="main">
            <p>The process of obtaining citizenship in the United States begins by becoming a permanent resident and obtaining a green card. Once completed, immigrants will have to live in the U.S. for five years, before they can apply for citizenship. They must be 18, have good moral character, the ability to speak, read, and write basic English, understand the principles of the U.S. Constitution and the U.S. history and government, and take an oath to the U.S. With those, a green card holder can apply for naturalization, which is when a foreigner is granted U.S. citizenship. It’s important to make sure all legalities are in order, to avoid complications and possible barring, deportation, and/or detainment. An application form and a $725 fee must be submitted to the USCIS. This is followed by a biometrics screening, where the applicant’s fingerprint and photograph are taken followed by an in-depth background check and cross-check. All checks must be cleared before the interview can be conducted. After the interview is completed the applicant must take the Civics and English tests. Finally, the applicant takes the oath of allegiance to the U.S. and officially becomes a citizen. With all the steps to take to become naturalized, the full process can take a year or more.</p>
